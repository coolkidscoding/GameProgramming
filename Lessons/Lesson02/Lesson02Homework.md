> Assignment

In this homework the student will be required to create a REPL using PyGame.  In this REPL the student will create an autonomous stick man.  The student should have a decent understanding of how movement occurs in a pygame.  The goal of this homework is to use the stick man code we created today and have the figure walk along the screen however you want.  

At a minimum the stick man should walk from one side of the screen to the other on his own.  He can walk a straght line or you can add a random turn to his path, your choice.  Have fun with this.

> This homework is due at the beginning of the next class and will be the first thing we go over.
